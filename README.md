# H6_API_Weather_App
## Description
The weather application allows the user to search for a city and get information not only about the current weather patterns, but also the next 5 days of weather forecasts. This is useful for people who are looking ahead if they are making plans or they know an event like a wedding is coming up. This was a true test of api skill and I learned a lot about using third party APIs to take their information and display it on something I created.
## Usage
Please search for a city and press the search button. At the top, you see the current weather and if you scroll further down, you will see the next 5 days weather forecasts.
